- You find yourself in a dark room. You cannot see anything.
>> [Feel your way around the room] You walk around, arms outstretched, trying to get a sense for what is in this room. ~
>> [Wait] You wait for several minutes.
>>> [Wait More] You continue to wait for another few minutes. @ROOM_1_WAIT
>>> [Feel your way around the room] You walk around, arms outstretched, trying to get a sense for what is in this room. ~

- You get a general sense for what is in the room. It appears to be very small, and perfectly square. 
Directly in front of you is a table, with a flashlight on it.
>> [Turn on the flashlight] You pick up the flashlight and turn it on. Suddenly, you can see the room much more clearly! 
The walls are entirely concrete, but behind the (wooden!) table is a steel door.
	>>> [Open the door] You squeeze past the table to reach the door. 
As you start opening it, light begins to fill the room, until finally it is flooded with a cool blue light from behind the door. @START_HALLWAY
	>>> [Look around more] You try to search further around the room, using your flashlight. 
	The room is extraordinarily bland, however you do notice that the ceiling is actually made of steel, much like the door. @ROOM_1_WAIT

>> [Continue searching] You ignore the flashlight, choosing to continue searching in the dark. ~

-- Searching in the dark yields few results. With no light, it is hard to find a way around the table in front of you. @ROOM_1_WAIT

- Suddenly, a blinding light fills the room. As you slowly gather your senses, you see a blue sky where the ceiling once was. @END
