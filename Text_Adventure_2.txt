$ ROOM_1_START

- You find yourself in a dark room. You cannot see anything.
>> [Feel your way around the room] You walk around, arms outstretched, trying to get a sense for what is in this room. ~
>> [Wait] You wait for several minutes.
>>> [Wait More] You continue to wait for another few minutes. @ROOM_1_WAIT
>>> [Feel your way around the room] You walk around, arms outstretched, trying to get a sense for what is in this room. ~

- You get a general sense for what is in the room. It appears to be very small, and perfectly square. 
Directly in front of you is a table, with a flashlight on it.
>> [Turn on the flashlight] You pick up the flashlight and turn it on. Suddenly, you can see the room much more clearly! 
The walls are entirely concrete, but behind the (wooden!) table is a steel door.
	>>> [Open the door] You squeeze past the table to reach the door. 
As you start opening it, light begins to fill the room, until finally it is flooded with a cool blue light from behind the door. @START_HALLWAY
	>>> [Look around more] You try to search further around the room, using your flashlight. 
	The room is extraordinarily bland, however you do notice that the ceiling is actually made of steel, much like the door. @ROOM_1_WAIT

>> [Continue searching] You ignore the flashlight, choosing to continue searching in the dark. ~

- Searching in the dark yields few results. With no light, it is hard to find a way around the table in front of you. @ROOM_1_WAIT

$ ROOM_1_WAIT
- Suddenly, a blinding light fills the room. As you slowly gather your senses, you see a blue sky where the ceiling once was.
 There is a door on the other side of the room, and a flashlight on a table in front of you.
 It appears the wall is more rough than you expected, and seems climbable.
>> [Open the door] You open the door. @START_HALLWAY
>> [Climb the wall] You climb up the wall, and out onto a roof. @ROOF_1
>> [Wait] You wait.

$ ROOM_1_POST_START
- You are back in the room where you started. The roof is missing, there is an open door on one side, and a wooden table in the middle.
  The wall is very rough, and seems climbable.
>> [Climb the wall] You climb up the wall, and out onto a roof. @ROOF_1
>> [Go through the door] You walk through the door, and into a hallway. @START_HALLWAY

$ START_HALLWAY
- You are in a long, steel hallway lit with cool fluorescent lights. On one end is the room you awoke in, and on the other a laboratory.
>> [Go to the lab] You go to the lab (TODO) @END
>> [Go to the room] You return to the room. @ROOM_1_POST_START

$ ROOF_1
- You are on the roof of a central building. There is a hole leading into the room you started in.
  Sprawling out around you is a complicated maze of passageways, rooms, and machinery, surrounded by a forest.
>> [Climb into the room] You climb back into the room you awoke in. @ROOM_1_POST_START
>> [Approach the edge of the building] You approach the edge of the building.
   Looking over the edge, you can see a vertical drop onto some grass. You doubt you can survive if you jump.
>>> [Jump onto the grass] You jump off the wall, and hit the grass headfirst. The last thing you hear is a loud ringing in your ears. @END
>>> [Look for a way down] As you look around, you notice a ladder not far from where you stand.
>>>> [Climb down the ladder] You climb down the ladder. Now on the grass, you see a dense forest in front of you, and a ring of grass around the building
>>>>> [Go into the forest] You walk into the dense forest. @FOREST_FROM_START
>>>>> [Walk around the building] You begin to walk around the building.
      You see a wide variety of different rooms, of different materials and sizes.
      None of these rooms have windows, preventing you from seeing inside.
      Eventually, you return to where you started.
>>>>> [Climb back up] You climb back onto the roof.  @ROOF_1
>>>> [Jump onto the grass] Ignoring the ladder, you jump off the wall. The last thing you hear is a loud ringing in your ears. @END
>>>> [Wait]

$ FOREST_FROM_START 
- You are in a forest. @END
